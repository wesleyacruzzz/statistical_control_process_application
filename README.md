# Statistical Process Control (SPC) applied to public beaches in Natal - Web application

The purpose of this project was to assess the conditions of 15 beaches regarding safeness for swimming in Natal, Brazil. For this we developed an web application using R Shiny.

The object of analysis was the concentration of coliforms (fecal deposits) in the sea water, this metric was compared to what is considered safe and cross-validated using SPC tools such as Control charts and process capability.

We hope researchers can find this web application informative in their own work, if you're interested in using this tool you can find it at: https://wesley-almeida-cruz-wess.shinyapps.io/CEP2/.
